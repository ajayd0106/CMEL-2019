# Computational Materials Engineering Lab - 2019
This repository contains the codes for the assignments given to solve in the course Computational Materials Engineering Lab at IIT Madras.
This course deals with:
- Solving Partials Differential equations
- Generating Crystal structures
- Generating Digital Microstructures

Currently this repository contains only code for Digital microstructures generated using MATLAB.

## Digital Microstructure
This Microstructure generated is a simulaton of soldification of a liquid and corresponding microstructural changes. 
Code used to generate the below gif can be found [here](https://github.com/ajayd0106/CMEL-2019/blob/master/codes/microstructure-simulation.m)
